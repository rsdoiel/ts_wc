Installation for development of **wc**
===========================================

**wc** This is an example of using Mistral Le Chat to recreate the POSIX &#x60;wc&#x60; command written in TypeScript. The full transcript is available at &lt;https://chat.mistral.ai/chat/e97f1834-4e60-451a-b317-adcc301dbf12&gt;.

Quick install with curl or irm
------------------------------

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS).

~~~shell
curl https://rsdoiel.github.io/wc/installer.sh | sh
~~~

This will install the programs included in wc in your `$HOME/bin` directory.

If you are running Windows 10 or 11 use the Powershell command below.
